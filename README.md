## Problem Motivation 
The main motivation of the project is to help the poor by giving books for free💰. The primary focus will be to help the poor, but it will also be helpful to other people as well.

## Problem Statement 

In these present situations, it is difficult for poor people to even afford food, thus affording money for buying books has become a big burden for their child's education 🧑‍🎓!!

## Problem Solution

- This website will play a major role in giving books to the poor for free which will be very helpful for them.

- The  👨‍💻donors will have to donate their old books to our website and we collect them and add them to our website.

- The sellers can come to our website and get the books for free of cost from our website💻.

## Project Overall Idea

- People who want to donate their books can login to this website and can fill in the details of the book like name, genre and condition of the book.

- If the book is in good condition to read, then the user can fill the address and then a pick up guy comes to receive it.

-  👨‍💻Donors will get points or coupons which will be helpful to buy books from the website with low cost!!

- The book will be posted on the website with title, edition, proper photo and grade of the book.

- Customers who are interested to buy the book can place an order with only delivery charges and order will be received as soon as possible.

- Customers can keep track of order and can contact customer care for any further queries and updates.

## Tools Required
